                        Hello! My name is Kyawt Kyawt San and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I joined the computing and information technology courses in <span><a href="#" class="uni-link">Info Myanmar University</a></span>  â€” where taught me a lot about software developments.                    </p>
                    <p className="content">
                        And then, I studied other things (frameworks, other programming languages) over internet.
                        My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.                    </p>
